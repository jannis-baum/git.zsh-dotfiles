# git.zsh dotfiles

This repository holds all my git and GitHub related zsh functions that let me
blaze through my workflow. To use them simply source all `.zsh` files from this
repo in your `.zshrc`. I do this by keeping this repository as a submodule in my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/jannis-baum/dotfiles.git).

## Requirements

- `git`, of course
- [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [the GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
